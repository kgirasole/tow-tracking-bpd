Buffalo Police Tow Tracking

Final project for CSE111 - Tracks Tow Reasons/District/Day/Month

This project was assigned during my first year at UB for my Computer Science I class. It is a data visualization application that allows the user to easily use Plotly graphs to parse and understand data from the BPD's public forum. It is written with Python and JavaScript, along with minimal HTML to display the graphs.

Collects the data from BPD, creates a CSV file, organizes the data, then uses Plotly to visualize the data on an HTML page.
